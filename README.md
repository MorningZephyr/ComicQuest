# This project is a comic reader. I will make it a web based, and then adapt to mobile if necessary


Here's the idea:

1. Load comic from a given website to the reader
2. Have option to download
3. Have libraries

AI related ideas: 

4. Have an ai section that generates character from a given image, so 
   like wallpapers or other kinds of image, so user can post an image
   and the ai will generate another image with user's taste
5. Have the ai narrate the comic via image recognition
6. Image to animation through use of ai 
7. Using ai in get higher qualit

## Roadmap for loading comic

1. Before the users choose their comic, we need to have right configurations to request information from websites
