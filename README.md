# This project is a comic reader. I will make it a web based, and then adapt to mobile if necessary


Here's the idea:
1. The reader will be hosted in a website
2. Load comic from a given website to the reader
3. Have option to download
4. Have libraries

AI related ideas: 

4. Have an ai section that generates character from a given image, so 
   like wallpapers or other kinds of image, so user can post an image
   and the ai will generate another image with user's taste
5. Have the ai narrate the comic via image recognition
6. Image to animation through use of ai 
7. Using ai in get higher image qualities

## Roadmap for loading comic

1. Before the users choose their comic, we need to have right configurations to request information from websites, those should be stored in json
2. When a website has many comics, then each of those comic element should be preserved so that it can be loaded as a whole in the website
3. The website html will be the container
4. Inside the container will contain comic elements. Then CSS can be used to organize the layout of the comic
5.
